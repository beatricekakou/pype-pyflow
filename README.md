<h1>Pipe-PyFlow: A Python ETL pipeline project</h1>

<h1>Project Overview</h1>
Pipe-PyFlow serves to help me exploring the world of computer science, and in this case, of Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipelines using Python.
Despite being a neophyte in this domain, my objective is to delve deeper into comprehending the mechanics, challenges, and best practices of building robust ETL pipelines, all while navigating through the extensive capabilities of Python.

<h1>Learning & Exploration</h1>
My focus will be on exploring:
<ul>
 <li>Data extraction from various source types.</li> 
  <li>Performing assorted data transformations, including cleansing, formatting, and aggregating.</li> 
  <li>Efficiently loading data into target destinations while ensuring integrity and reliability</li> 
</ul>

<h1>Contributing</h1>
Contributions and suggestions about how to improve this project are welcome!
