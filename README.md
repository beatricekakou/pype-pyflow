<h1>Pipe-pyflow: a Python ETL pipeline project</h1>

<h1>Project Overview</h1>
Pipe-PyFlow serves to help me exploring the world of computer science, and in this case, of Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipelines using Python.
Despite being a neophyte in this domain, my objective is to delve deeper into comprehending the mechanics, challenges, and best practices of building robust ETL pipelines.

<h1>Learning & Exploration</h1>
My focus will be on exploring:
<ul>
 <li>Data extraction.</li> 
  <li>Performing  data transformations.</li> 
  <li>Efficiently loading data into target destinations while ensuring integrity and reliability</li> 
</ul>

<h1>Contributing</h1>
Contributions and suggestions about how to improve this project are welcome!
